# Upstream tracking

How `mathewclarkau/cmux-linux` relates to
[`manaflow-ai/cmux`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), and how to re-sync.

See also [`PROVENANCE.md`](./PROVENANCE.md) for the original vendor anchors and
licensing. This file is the living **drift ledger** (issue #29).

## Release ↔ upstream map

| Our release | Merged-from upstream | Upstream HEAD at integration | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| v0.1.0 | (initial vendor) | `adc48877a` | Anchor for `mux/` + `daemon/remote/` |
| v0.4.0 | (n/a — port-only) | `7652d3b1c` (observed, not integrated) | First large port divergence: session CLI, agent hooks, Linux lifecycle |
| *next after #29 batch 1* | `d19f59aa2` (PATH fix only) | `7652d3b1c` | See [Integration log](#integration-log) |

Update this table on every release that either integrates upstream commits or
deliberately ships further port-only work while upstream advances.

## What we deliberately do NOT carry

| Area | Why skipped |
|------|-------------|
| Swift / AppKit / macOS app | Linux port surface is `mux/` + `daemon/remote/` + Ghostty VT only |
| iOS recovery, macOS notifications | Platform-specific |
| Upstream MSRV 1.88 / edition 2024 (`760e343d0`) | We pin **Rust 1.75.0** in CI (`pr-build.yml`); adopting requires a coordinated toolchain bump PR |
| `npx`/`uvx` publish pipelines, Freestyle cloud slots | Distribution / cloud product paths, not the Linux TUI core |
| Sidebar plugin manager (`a19223059`, `a1c5295dd`) | Large feature; evaluate after MSRV / protocol alignment |
| Full protocol-6 + window-manager socket surface | Needs careful merge against our hooks + session CLI; batch later |

## Re-sync procedure

Run this on a cadence (monthly is fine; sooner if a remote-PTY or mux bug is
known fixed upstream). Owner: whoever is on rotation.

### 1. Fetch and inventory

```bash
# Side clone (do not put this inside the cmux-linux worktree)
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux.git /tmp/cmux-upstream
cd /tmp/cmux-upstream
ANCHOR=$(grep -oE 'manaflow-ai/cmux@[0-9a-f]{7,}' \
  /path/to/cmux-linux/PROVENANCE.md | head -1 | cut -d@ -f2)
# Prefer the latest "Integrated through" SHA from PROVENANCE.md Anchor history.
git fetch origin "$ANCHOR" HEAD
git log --oneline "${ANCHOR}..HEAD" -- mux/ daemon/remote/
```

### 2. Classify each commit

For every commit that touches `mux/` or `daemon/remote/`, label it:

| Label | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **(a) integrate** | Linux-port-relevant, applies cleanly or with small edits | Cherry-pick / port into a `re-sync(upstream @ <sha>)` PR |
| **(b) skip** | macOS-only, product packaging, or superseded by our port | Document in the tally; do not code |
| **(c) defer** | Relevant but conflicts with our hooks / MSRV / protocol work | Call out; schedule a later batch |

### 3. Integrate in batches

- One PR per batch. Commit message pattern:

  ```
  re-sync(upstream @ <shortsha>): <one-line summary of what landed>

  Integrated: <list>
  Skipped: <count + reason summary>
  Deferred: <count + reason summary>
  ```

- Prefer cherry-picks of focused Go/`daemon/remote` fixes first (smaller
  conflict surface). Large `mux/` rewrites (MSRV, plugins, rebrand) need their
  own planning PR.

### 4. Update docs in the same PR

1. Append a row to [Release ↔ upstream map](#release--upstream-map) if this
   batch will ship in a named release; otherwise update the integration log.
2. Append to **Anchor history** in `PROVENANCE.md` (never overwrite prior rows).
3. Bump the "Integrated through" / "Classified against" SHAs.
4. Release notes for the next tag should include:

   ```
   Upstream: integrated <range or list>; classified against manaflow-ai/cmux@<sha>
   ```

### 5. Do not re-sync Ghostty here

`ghostty/` tracks `manaflow-ai/ghostty` on its own pin + `patches/`. Re-syncing
the submodule pointer is a separate change from `mux/` / `daemon/remote/`.

## Classification snapshot (against `7652d3b1c`, 2026-07-23)

28 commits touch `mux/` or `daemon/remote/` between anchor `adc48877a` and
upstream HEAD `7652d3b1c`. Full tally at classification time:

## Integration log

### Batch 1 — `re-sync(upstream @ d19f59aa2)` (issue #29)

- **Integrated:** `d19f59aa2` — remote PTY PATH always includes standard executable directories (`/usr/bin`, `/bin`, …) so a restricted daemon PATH does not strand interactive shells.
- **Skipped / deferred:** see table above (27 remaining of the 28-commit window).
- **Code anchor for `daemon/remote/` PATH helper:** still rooted at original vendor `adc48877a`, plus this cherry-picked fix.
- **`mux/` code anchor:** unchanged at `adc48877a` (+ our port commits).
