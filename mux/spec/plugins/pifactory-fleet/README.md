# pifactory-fleet (cmux plugin example)

Worked-example plugin for cmux-linux's plugin loader. Closes the last
remaining acceptance criterion of [issue #42][i42]: a real, installable
plugin that adapts the cmux verbs `scripts/cmux-panel-lib.sh` from the
[pifactory][pifactory] repo uses, so a fleet operator can drive
multi-pane agent dispatch via `cmux pifactory-fleet <verb>` instead of
sourcing the shell library by hand.

`scripts/cmux-panel-lib.sh` lives outside cmux-linux"

## What this plugin does

`cmux-panel-lib.sh` is the shell glue pifactory's lead agents call to
dispatch worker panes (`cmux_dispatch_worker_pane`,
`cmux_dispatch_worker_pane_interactive`). It is a thin wrapper around
the cmux CLI verbs `split`, `rename-surface`, `send --text ...` (often
`--send-cr`), and `close-workspace`.

`pifactory-fleet` re-exposes the same operations as cmux-plugin verbs:

| Verb       | Underlying cmux verb(s) | Notes                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ping`     | `identify`              | read-only smoke test               |
| `status`   | `list-workspaces`       | read-only snapshot                 |
| `deploy`   | `new-workspace`         | one cmux_call per role             |
| `dispatch` | `new-workspace`         | one cmux_call (anchor for workers) |
| `rollback` | `close-workspace`       | one cmux_call per closed workspace |

All `cmux_call` traffic is mediated by the wasmtime host
(`mux/crates/mux-tui/src/plugin_host.rs`): the plugin receives a
per-call auth token, and every forwarded request is checked against
the manifest's verb allowlist and `socket = "write"` capability
before reaching the control socket.

```

`bin/fleet.sh` is **reference material only** — it documents the
adapter logic in the cmux-panel-lib.sh idiom (one bash function per
verb, each function shelling out to `cmux <verb>`). The cmux loader
itself only executes `bin/fleet.wasm`, which is built from
`src/lib.rs` and implements the same verb set in Rust.

## Build

The plugin's `entry` (`bin/fleet.wasm`) is a wasm32-unknown-unknown
artifact. Build it from this directory with:

```sh
./build.sh
```

`build.sh` runs `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
--target-dir target` and copies the resulting `fleet.wasm` into
`bin/`. Requires:

- `cargo` 1.80+ (wasmtime 27 host crate in cmux-linux MSRVs at 1.80;
  the plugin's own crate MSRVs at 1.75 and builds with the same
  pinned toolchain as cmux-linux).
- The `wasm32-unknown-unknown` rustup target:
  `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

The build is hermetic (no network needed if the registry cache is
warm). It does not pull in any cmux-linux code; the plugin's WASM
talks to cmux through the three host imports defined in
`mux/crates/mux-tui/src/plugin_host.rs`:

```rust
fn cmux_token() -> u64;        // (ptr << 32) | len of token bytes
fn cmux_call(req_ptr, req_len, out_ptr, out_cap) -> i32;
fn cmux_log(level, ptr, len);  // 0=info, 1=warn, 2=error, other=debug
```

## Install

```sh
cmux plugin install ./cmux-plugin.toml
cmux plugin list                 # should show pifactory-fleet enabled
```

That command copies this directory (minus the build artefacts) into
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/cmux/plugins/pifactory-fleet/` and appends an entry
to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/cmux/plugins.json`. The install path validates the
manifest, refuses symlinks (see `mux/crates/mux-tui/src/plugin.rs`
`cmd_install`), and registers the plugin as enabled by default.

## Invoke

```sh
cmux pifactory-fleet ping
cmux pifactory-fleet status
cmux pifactory-fleet deploy   workpieces/p1
cmux pifactory-fleet rollback workpieces/p1
```

Each invocation is one wasmtime instantiation: the loader mints a
fresh per-call auth token (see
`mux/crates/mux-tui/src/plugin_host.rs::mint_token`), validates the
requested verb against the manifest's `verbs` allowlist, runs the
plugin with the manifest's `fuel` + `max_runtime_ms` budgets, and
returns non-zero on any failure.

## Single-call-per-invocation limitation

The loader's `expected_request_id` is initialised to 0 and never
incremented after `cmux_call` (see
`plugin_host.rs::define_host_imports`, which reads but does not
bump the counter). A second `cmux_call` from the same plugin
invocation therefore fails with `StaleId { expected: 0, got: 1 }`.

`pifactory-fleet`'s verbs are designed around this constraint: each
verb makes at most one `cmux_call`. The README of a future loader
fix that increments `expected_request_id` per call can lift this
restriction without changing the manifest schema. This is tracked
as a known issue — see `cmux-linux/AGENTS.md` follow-ups.

## Extending

To add a new verb:

1. Add it to `verbs` in `cmux-plugin.toml` (so the loader accepts it
   on the argv path AND so it appears in the cmux_call allowlist).
2. Add a `cmux_call` branch in `src/lib.rs` that builds the
   `{"id":0,"verb":"<cmux-verb>","args":{...}}` request.
3. Mirror the logic in `bin/fleet.sh` so the shell reference stays
   in sync.
4. Re-run `./build.sh` and re-install.

If the verb is mutating and the manifest declares `socket = "read"`,
the loader will reject it as `WriteBlocked`. Bump the manifest's
`[plugin.capabilities].socket` to `"write"` (this plugin already is).

## Tests

- `mux/crates/mux-tui/tests/cli.rs::plugin_install_list_uninstall_round_trip`
  is the closest existing analogue; it round-trips a hand-rolled
  `pifactory-fleet`-shaped manifest through `cmux plugin
install/list/uninstall` and asserts the registry state.
- `mux/crates/mux-tui/src/plugin.rs::tests::example_pifactory_fleet_manifest_parses`
  (added with this plugin) parses the actual `cmux-plugin.toml` from
  this directory and asserts the schema values match the contract
  documented above. It is a manifest-level test, not a runtime test
  — it does not require the `bin/fleet.wasm` to be built.

## Security

The plugin manifest sets `socket = "write"` so the plugin can
dispatch workers. Reduce to `"read"` if you only need the
read-only verbs (`ping`, `status`). The `filesystem = []` default
keeps the WASI preopen set to the plugin's install dir only; add
specific paths under `[plugin.capabilities].filesystem` to grant
more (paths that do not exist on disk are silently skipped by
`build_wasi`).

`network = "off"` blocks WASI preview2 sockets. The preview1 sockets
that wasmtime exposes by default are not wired up in
`build_wasi`, so network is effectively unavailable regardless.
