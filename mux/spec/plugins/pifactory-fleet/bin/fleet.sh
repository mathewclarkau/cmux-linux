#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/fleet.sh - Reference shell adapter for the pifactory-fleet cmux
# plugin.
#
# This file is the human-readable counterpart to src/lib.rs (which
# compiles to bin/fleet.wasm and is what the cmux plugin loader
# actually executes). It documents the adapter logic in the same
# idiom as scripts/cmux-panel-lib.sh in the pifactory repo:
# one bash function per plugin verb, each function shelling out to
# the underlying `cmux <verb>` CLI.
#
# It is NOT executed by `cmux pifactory-fleet <verb>` — that path
# runs the WASM adapter. This file exists so a reader who knows the
# cmux-panel-lib.sh idiom can immediately map the plugin's verbs to
# the cmux verbs it wraps, and so a future plugin-ecosystem tooling
# (e.g. a hypothetical "shell-script plugin loader") has a starting
# point.
#
# Not meant to be sourced. Not meant to be installed. It lives in
# bin/ alongside the .wasm so the directory layout is consistent:
# both the runtime artifact and its source-of-truth reference are in
# bin/.

# dispatch happens via `pifactory_fleet_dispatch`; `deploy` only

# from scripts/cmux-panel-lib.sh, minus the prompt — the operator
# supplies the prompt after the workspace is up (the prompt itself
# goes through the cmux_panel_lib dispatch command in a separate
