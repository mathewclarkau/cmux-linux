# lib/panel.sh - Glue stub for the pifactory-fleet plugin.
#
# This file mirrors the cmux verbs that the upstream
# scripts/cmux-panel-lib.sh (in the pifactory repo) wraps, but
# expressed in the cmux-plugin manifest shape so a plugin consumer
# can see exactly which cmux verbs the plugin's verbs correspond to.
#
# It is NOT sourced by anything in this directory. The plugin's
# runtime artifact is bin/fleet.wasm (built from src/lib.rs); this
# file is the documented bridge from the plugin's surface to the
# underlying cmux verb set.
#
# Why it exists:
#   - cmux-panel-lib.sh is the source of truth for the pifactory
#     fleet's cmux glue. It is not vendored here because it lives in
#     a separate repo.
#   - The mapping from plugin verb -> cmux verb is small but
#     non-obvious (e.g. "deploy" -> new-workspace, not "send"). A
#     short reference file alongside the WASM keeps the rationale
#     close to the code that implements it.
#
# Australian English. No em dashes.

# pifactory_panel_verb_map <plugin-verb>
# Echo the cmux verb (or verb sequence) the given plugin verb maps
# to. This is a pure mapping helper for documentation; the WASM
# adapter (src/lib.rs) hard-codes the same map.
#
# Output: a single cmux verb name, or "<verb>+<verb>" to denote a
# multi-step sequence (note: the current loader permits only one
# cmux_call per invocation, so multi-step sequences are deferred to
# a future loader fix that increments expected_request_id per call).
