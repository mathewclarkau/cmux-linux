#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build.sh - Compile the pifactory-fleet plugin's WASM adapter.
#
# Produces bin/fleet.wasm from src/lib.rs via cargo's
# wasm32-unknown-unknown target. Idempotent: re-running rebuilds in
# place.
#
# Requires:
#   - cargo (1.75+; tested against the cmux-linux toolchain pin of 1.97)
#   - the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` rustup target
#     (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
#
# Does NOT require:
#   - the cmux-linux build toolchain (no zig vendored here — this
#     crate is freestanding and does not link against mux-tui or
#     wasmtime at compile time; the wasmtime side is the host)
#   - network access, after the first build (cargo caches in
#     `target/`).
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh
#
# Output:
#   bin/fleet.wasm   the loader-installable artifact (commit this
#                    into the repo so users can install without
#                    needing a wasm32 toolchain themselves)
